# Bioinformatician Website

This repository contains the source code for a web-based bioinformatics platform designed to assist users in searching, analyzing, and exploring protein sequences.

The website allows users to:
1. Search for proteins by family and organism using NCBI Entrez.
2. View and select protein sequences for further analysis.
3. Perform multiple sequence alignment, motif detection, and structure prediction.
4. Manage query history and sessions for a more personalized experience.

All core functionalities, including sequence search, user login, data visualization, and result display, are implemented in PHP, Python, JavaScript, and CSS.

For a detailed explanation of the projectâ€™s features, structure, and technical implementation, please visit the developer information page:(./about.php) on the website.
